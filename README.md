The goal of the project is to create a product catalog system that ensures fast access, efficient searching and undo operations using appropriate data structures.


### System Architecture & Data Structures

### Purpose of Data Structures
- **LinkedList** – Base product storage for insert operations  
- **HashTable** – Fast product search and lookup  
- **Stack** – Undo feature using LIFO logic  
- **Queue** – Tracks recently added products (FIFO, fixed size)  
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)** – Efficient sorting  
- **Array** – Temporary storage & UI data binding


### Performance Characteristics

- **Insertion:** Efficient with LinkedList  
- **Search:** Fast average-case lookup with HashTable  
- **Sorting:** In-order traversal of BST  
- **Filtering:** Category-based filtering via HashTable
